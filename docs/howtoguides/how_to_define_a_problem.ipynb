    "# How to define a multiobjective optimization problem in DESDEO\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we show how multiobjective optimization problems can be defined\n",
    "in DESDEO. We showcase multiple types of variables, constraints, and objective\n",
    "functions. We then show how these can be combined to formulate a multiobjective\n",
    "optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vehicle design problem\n",
    "In this example, we consider a vehicle design problem with three objective\n",
    "functions.  The goal is to minimize cost $C(x_1, x_2, \\mathbf{y})$, minimize\n",
    "emissions $E(x_1, x_2, \\mathbf{y})$, and maximize a performance index $P(x_1,\n",
    "x_2, \\mathbf{y})$ of the vehicle being designed. These objective functions are\n",
    "functions of the engine size ($x_1$, in liters), the number of cylinders\n",
    "($x_2$), and the percentage material composition of the vehicle\n",
    "($\\mathbf{y}=[y_1, y_2]$; $y_1$ percentage of aluminum, $y_2$ percentage of\n",
    "steel). These variables are also subject to two constraints: the safety rating\n",
    "of the vehicle  $g(\\mathbf{y})$ must meet or exceed a specific value ($S=35$), and the fuel\n",
    "efficiency $f(x_1, x_2, \\mathbf{y})$ must meet or exceed a specific threshold ($FE=20$).\n",
    "All the variables values must in addition be positive. The variable $x_1$ must\n",
    "be greater or equal than 4, and not exceed the value 30; and the variable $x_2$\n",
    "must be greater or equal than 2, and not exceed the value 24. In addition, when\n",
    "calculating performance, there is an ideal number of cylinders $IC=8$. Deviating\n",
    "from this value will result in a performance penalty.  Finally, the composition\n",
    "percentages must sum to 100$, i.e., $y_1 + y_2 = 100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With some mock functions, we can define the vehicle design problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Minimize} \\quad & C(x_1, x_2, \\mathbf{y}) = 5000x_1 + 2000x_2 + 100y_1 + 50y_2 \\\\\n",

    "\\text{Maximize} \\quad & P(x_1, x_2, \\mathbf{y}) = 10x_1 + 5x_2 - 0.2y_2 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Subject to} \\quad & f(x_1, x_2, \\mathbf{y}) = 25 - 0.2x_1 - 0.1x_2 + 0.05y_1 + 0.03y_2 \\geq FE \\\\\n",
    "& g(\\mathbf{y}) = 0.8y_1 + 0.6y_2 \\geq S \\\\\n",
    "& 0 \\leq x_1 \\leq 30, \\quad 0 \\leq x_2 \\leq 24 \\\\\n",

    "& y_1 \\geq 0, \\quad y_2 \\geq 0.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",

    "\n",
    "## Basic variables\n",
    "By _basic variable_, we refer to variables that can be represented by a scalar variable. In the vehicle design problem,these\n",
    "correspond to $x_1$ and $x_2$. To define these variables, we use the class `Variable` from the `desdeo.problem` module as follows:\n"
